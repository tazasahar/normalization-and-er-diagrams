# Data Normalization and Entity-Relationship Diagramming

The following table, representing students in a course, is already in [first normal form](https://knowledge.kitchen/A_Simple_Guide_to_Five_Normal_Forms_in_Relational_Database_Theory#FIRST_NORMAL_FORM) (1NF) - all records have the same number of fields, and there is only one value per field.

## Requirements

### Convert to 3NF

Convert this table to the [third normal form](https://knowledge.kitchen/A_Simple_Guide_to_Five_Normal_Forms_in_Relational_Database_Theory#Third_Normal_Form) (3NF) using the techniques we have learned in this class.

### Draw an Entity-Relationship Diagram

Draw an Entity-Relationship Diagram(s) of your 3NF-compliant data tables. Use the tool, [draw.io](https://draw.io) (also known as diagrams.net) to create these diagrams. A [sample .drawio file](./images/example-er-diagrams.drawio) has been included in this repository for example.

- export the diagram(s) in SVG format into the directory named `images`.
- publish the diagram(s) to your report, as described below.

### Write a report

Write a wonderfully-formatted Markdown report in the file named `README.md`. Make sure your document renders nicely as a web page, with clear headings, sub-headings, and text. Include a full description of your solution explaining what about the original data set was not 3NF compliant and what changes you made to make it 3NF-compliant. Be specific, and include at a minimum:

- a table containing the original data set (research how to write tables in Markdown or simply see the example table in this document's source code)
- your description of what makes this data set not compliant with 3NF
- tables containing the 3NF-compliant version of the data set
- the ER diagram(s) you created of your 3NF-compliant version of the data set (this diagram must be visible on the `README.md` document, not simply linked from there - research how to publish images to your pages in Markdown or simply see the example image in this document's source code)
- your description of what changes you made and how these changes make the data 3NF-compliant

## Submit your work

Each student must submit this assignment individually. Use Visual Studio Code to perform git `stage`, `commit` and `push` actions to submit. These actions are all available as menu items in Visual Studio Code's Source Control panel.

1. Type a short note about what you have done to the files in the `Message` area, and then type `Command-Enter` (Mac) or `Control-Enter` (Windows) to perform git `stage` and `commit` actions.
1. Click the `...` icon next to the words, "Source Control" and select "Push" to perform the git `push` action. This will upload your work to your repository on GitHub.com.
